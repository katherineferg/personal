Netflix - the big one. I was lucky enough to work on the migration of Netflix's internal document system when they moved from another hosting site to CloudCannon. Used by 13,000 employees, I copied over content from their current internal doc site, and formatted it into their new docs on CloudCannon. A lot of the styling was already completed, however there was a lot of tweaking to do, and ensuring clear communication with Netflix so they knew what was changed. This was a huge job that took my team weeks to get done, but we did it. And saying "I did work for Netflix" was pretty awesome.
