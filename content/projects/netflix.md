Netflix - the big one. I was lucky enough to work on the migration of Netflix's internal document system when they moved from another hosting site to CloudCannon. Used by 13,000 employees, I copied over content from their current internal doc site, and formatted it into their new docs on CloudCannon. A lot of the styling was already completed, however there was a lot of tweaking to do, and ensuring clear communication with Netflix so they knew what was changed. This was a huge job that took my team weeks to get done, but we did it. And saying "I did work for Netflix" was pretty awesome.

Praeteritis, inquit, gaudeo. Praeteritis, inquit, gaudeo. Quod, inquit, quamquam voluptatibus quibusdam est saepe iucundius, tamen expetitur propter voluptatem. Scientiam pollicentur, quam non erat mirum sapientiae cupido patria esse cariorem. Non quaeritur autem quid naturae tuae consentaneum sit, sed quid disciplinae. Ita ne hoc quidem modo paria peccata sunt. Ita prorsus, inquam; Nunc ita separantur, ut disiuncta sint, quo nihil potest esse perversius. Virtutibus igitur rectissime mihi videris et ad consuetudinem nostrae orationis.
