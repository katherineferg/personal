CloudCannon is a visual CMS that makes creating websites easy for non devs! I was hired as an intern for them in December 2023, and then became a full-time Junior Software Engineer in March 2024. As this was my first experience post-study, I was able to learn about all things in the development world, from the best there is.

I was put in charge of updating CloudCannon's pricing page on their marketing site. I created a toggle button that would switch between monthly and yearly payment options. This allowed potential new customers to use a visual and fun button that clearly showed all pricing differences. I had a lot of help when building this, but I loved the end result and learnt a lot. The button also links to another part of the page, ensuring both toggle buttons change at the same time.

This was my debut work for CloudCannon itself - all my other work was for clients, so it was awesome to be able to contribute to the company's website, which is still there today https://cloudcannon.com/pricing/
