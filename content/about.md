      <p>10 years after leaving high school, I decided to study for the first
      time. I spent one year learning online, where I completed my Level 5
      diploma in Web Development and Design. Throughout that year I learnt the
      basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We build our own basic front-end
      focused websites, and went on to backend development. This included API's,
      schemas, and authentication. </p><p>During my studies, I worked at the
      Office Manager for CloudCannon LTD. CloudCannon is a Dunedin startup
      focused on simplifying the complexities of website management. They do
      this by combining a powerful, user-friendly CMS, with seamless SSG
      integration. I was so lucky to be able to work and study in a beautiful
      office, with extremely talented developers who always gave me expert
      advice and help when I needed it along the way.</p><p>In December 2023 I
      was hired as a Web Development Intern for CloudCannon, working in the
      Enterprise Success Team. For three months I was exposed to exciting and
      challenging tasks like learning new languages, SSGs, and taking on client
      work. I Implemented accessibility features to ensure inclusivity for all
      users on our existing templates, and I optimised websites for search
      engines by implementing SEO best practices to improve visibility and
      organic traffic. The coolest project I worked on was for our biggest
      client - Netflix. I helped migrate Netflix's internal documentation
      websites from another site host, to CloudCannon. It was such rewarding
      work, backed by the best people. Then after my internship, I was hired by
      CloudCannon as a full-time Junior Software/engineer! This is where I got
      to put everything I had learnt into practice.</p><p>Currently, I'm
      continuing to learn in my spare time by using Code Academy, and building
      my own sites for fun! </p>
